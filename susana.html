	<p>Dear Eillen,
		<br>
		Thank you for your recent application to join us at
		the University of Awesome's science faculty to studyas part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions
		one by one, in the following sections.
	</p>
	<h3> Starting dates</h3>
	<p> We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
		could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
	</p>
	<style>
		ul {
			width: 60%;
			padding-rigth: 15px;
			margin-rigth: 15px;
			float: left;
		}
	</style>
	<ul>
		<li>First semester:9 september 2016</li>
		<li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
		<li>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li>
	</ul>
	<P> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so wich start date you would prefer.
	</P>
	<P> You Can find more information about<a href="https://www.thebridge.tech/"> important university dates</a> on our
		website.</P>
	<h3> Subjects of study</h3>
	<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -as long as the subjects fall
		somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
		the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
		by are as follows, in order of priority:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<ol>1.Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14 H12 O3.)</ol>
		<ol> 2.Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30 grados(86 F), when
			the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3X 10>3 X10.)</ol>
		<ol>3.HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</ol>
	</ul>
	<p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how you'd espect the research to
		take, required staff and other resources, and anything else yoy think we'd need to know? Thanks.
	</p>
	<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
	<P> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
		question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</P>
	<p> Polynesian chicken dance</p>
	<P> A little Known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC, a whole village would dance around in a
		circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</P>
	<P>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</P>
	<P>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved
		hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very
		rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thougt this dance inspired modem styles such as
		twerking.</P>
	<P> Arctic robot dance</P>
	<P> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a
		new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northem Alaska
		and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
		cold.</P>
	<P> For more of my researc, see my <a href="https://www.thebridge.tech/"> exotic dance research page.</a></P>
	<P> Yours Sincerely,</P>
	<P> Dr. Eleanor Gaye</P>
